## Description

> This study guide collects and organizes the most important learning concepts from my prework modules in my full stack flex bootcamp. Topis include Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
> 
> I deepened my understanding of the topic's key concepts by putting newly acquired skills into action. I also became more familiar with **GitBash**, **VSCode**, **Google Chrome Dev**, **Git flow**, and a variety of keyboard shortcuts.

## Usage

The guide is organized into four study areas for student review including Git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript:

1. First, visit the webpage and open the DevTools console by pressing `Control+Shift+I` (Windows) or `Command+Option+I` (MacOS). 

2. Next, view the "console" tab. JavaScript will randomly pick one of the four content areas for you to study first. A new random selection is made when the page is refreshed.
